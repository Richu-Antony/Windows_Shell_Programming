Simply download the Hex folder, open it and double click 'Hex.bat' to run the Batch script. Read the "introduction.md" file so you will have a basic idea as to how the code works and how to train Hex. If trained properly, trust me it can often scare you with its replies.

Reports:

I tried to upload my replylog folder but github didn't let me upload more than 100 files at that time. So, i had to not include that folder. But it's okay, as soon as you start a new chat Hex will create it's own copy of Replylog folder from the Noreplylog folder. But, you have to teach the bot since it is new born and doesn't know anything besides what I added to the Replylog folder.

[Hint]: Delete 'Chat\Replylog' folder to reset Hex's memory(whatever YOU taught it.)
chat\[Teachbot.bat] can be used to change the contents of Noreplylog folder.
